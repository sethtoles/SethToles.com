				I started illustrating, as most people do, as soon as I was able to hold a crayon, and though I often got lost in a drawing or painting, illustration never became the focal point of my life. As such, when planning out this website, I was inclined to just include my illustrations amongst my graphic design work, as they are both about using imagery to convey information. However, I found there to be an important distinction that set them apart. Where my graphic design work is about organizing and condensing data into accessible forms, my illustrations try to stretch ideas out and tell stories. As much as I am inclined towards the more precise and practical nature of graphic design, illustration keeps calling me back.

				My relationship with video began around the age of 10, when my parents first allowed me to play with their camcorder. Without editing software or tape decks, I edited my short movies in-camera, rewinding to the right spot for each cut and re-recording, usually multiple times, until the timing was right and the take was good. Needless to say, when I first experienced Final Cut Pro as a freshman in high school, I was ecstatic, and quickly fell in love with the digital editing process. I started doing videography for plays and events, but was dissatisfied with the lack of creativity these jobs required. To make the work more interesting, I taught myself how to build intricate DVD menus, for which I would create simple 2D and 3D animations. However, I didn't really scratch the surface of animation until I was able to take a few computer animation classes in college.

			<section class="catDesc">
				When I first started editing digital graphics, I was using the lasso and pencil tools in AppleWorks, changing recognizable logos to be somewhat humorous and often crude. Exactly how I progressed from those beginnings to paying work is a bit hazy, but it certainly involved teaching myself Photoshop and demonstrating an ability to produce original designs. My early work was mostly on posters, and occasionally icon design, both of which posed fun challenges, but my interest was really piqued when I started doing web design. In designing websites, I was practicing layout and iconography together, and had to add in the element of user experience. It is this kind of multi-faceted challenge that I find most fulfilling.
				<br><br>As a large part of building a website is writing the code, I will include a note on projects which are also listed in the Code section. Entries here will focus exclusively on the design process.

				Much to my disappointment, my high school didn't provide any programming classes, so when I started building websites, I had to figure things out for myself. My first steps were in Dreamweaver, which allowed me to lay out my site visually. I could then open up the source code and play with attributes to figure out what they did. Using this method, I got pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS, but when I got to Javascript, I had to turn to online resources. By the end of high school I could do basic DOM manipulation, and was just starting to look into PHP. My first year at college, I finally took two introductory programming courses, which filled me in on some core concepts, and one advanced course, building a ray-tracer in C++, which at the time, was one of the most challenging projects I had ever taken on. With this foundation, my interest and skills have only continued to grow.

				If I had gone to any other college, I would probably have majored in either computer science, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering. Instead I went to Hampshire College, which doesn't have majors at all, so I split my time between aspects of all three, ending my time there concentrating on robotics. This had its difficulties, as there was no robotics program at Hampshire, but ultimately the resources were available, and the atmosphere was incredibly supportive of self-driven learning. Robotics is still relatively new to me, but it provides exactly the kind of complex problem solving I'm always looking for, and I can't imagine a better application of my skills, than to a field which is I see as poised to massively improve quality of life for countless people.

				From the moment my father taught me to swing a hammer, learning new tools has come naturally to me, and I have rarely been at a loss in figuring out how to put something together. This comfort with craft has given me the opportunity to ask more important questions: instead of "How can this come together?" I ask, "How <i>should</i> this come together? What approach will be strongest, look the best, and most positively affect the end-product's usability?" As I gain skills and experience, these questions only become more apparent and important, but they have always been there, driving the process of everything I make.

				While most of the things I make these days are designed to serve a function, I still feel inclined to make the occasional piece that exists only for its own sake. I would not say I've made anything that has an intended "meaning," but instead I find an undeniable satisfaction in creating something that's simply nice to look at and have around. It's not a particularly noble goal, but this is what drives my sculpture. Despite the very spacial and visual way I have of experiencing the world, I have never found sculpture an effective medium for pouring out emotion, or conveying a message. Instead, it is a sort of meditation, or in some cases, a puzzle, but one whose solution must come organically.

				Although I have worked briefly in a few food prep and service jobs, cooking is the one skill on this list that I have never done professionally. In fact, I really only started cooking for myself about two years ago. Even so, in that time it has become hugely important to me. Other than simple standbys, I avoid making the same dish twice, I cook across multiple cuisines, and go out of my way to make as much of the meal from scratch as I can, just to get a better sense of all the ingredients. When I found myself spending more time on every meal, I started taking pictures to track my progression, and in planning this site, I came across those pictures and thought, "Sure, I'll include my cooking! Why not?" The projects in other sections may have taken days, weeks, or months to complete, whereas even a complex meal may only take a few hours, so the format here may be a little different, but I want to present cooking as a significant part of my life.
