				I started illustrating, as many people do, as soon as I was able to hold a crayon, and though I often got lost in a drawing or painting, illustration never became the focal point of my life. My preferred methods of working visually usually revolve around organizing and condensing information, which fits graphic design work well, but doesn't lend itself to what I think makes successful illustration. It is when I want to stretch ideas out and tell stories with my imagery that I turn to the more fluid process of illustration.

					<h2>Song Reader Album Cover</h2>
					<h4>(Photoshop,&nbsp;June&nbsp;2013)</h4>
					<p>
					When my good friend and musician <a href="http://maxmiller.bandcamp.com/" target="_blank">Max Miller</a> told me he was going to record a full version of Beck's latest album, Song Reader, I knew I wanted to be a part of the project. Beck released Song Reader only as a booklet of sheet music, so if you wanted to hear it, you would have to play it yourself. As a huge admirer of Beck's work, Max was ecstatic about this opportunity, and immediately began the huge undertaking of recording the entire album. I'm a fan of Beck as well, and loved the concept of the album, so when Max mentioned he needed a cover for his interpretation, I immediately offered to help.
					</p>
					<p>
					Max gave me a basic idea of what he was looking for: the Song Reader sheet music came with custom artwork for each song, often depicting various characters, and he wanted some of these characters to be depicted in a landscape with music notes scattered about, with both himself and his logo pictured as well. Based on this, I started forming an image, which had a similar composition to the final product, but was much lighter in tone. It was when I first heard the album that my mental image became much darker, and the elements more surreal. When I started sketching, I looked up some sheets of musical symbols to see what I might be able to incorporate into the landscape. I had the idea from the beginning to make the clouds out of quarter notes, and to line the ground, reminiscent of staff lines or the strings of an instrument, an idea that I remembered from a bit of the original Fantasia movie. I thought I would make the sun from a whole note, but in looking over sets of symbols, I found the coda, which was more recognizable as a symbol, and turned out to have a meaning that fit with my overall concept for the image. I also realized I could turn the curly bracket, which couples staves into a mountain range. Finally, I wanted to build a small city in the distance out of various other symbols, from half rests to guitar tabs, with sharp sign power lines running through.
					</p>
					<p>
					My general concept for the image, which came to me when first hearing the album was of a surreal world, built from the notation of Beck's ideas, and inhabited by the odd creatures that went along with this notation. Coming into this world was Max and his own musical creativity, which would mark a change in this world forever. This idea really solidified when I found the coda symbol, which in music, can symbolize the conclusion of a passage. With this in mind, I drew Max's logo in the foreground as a portal, which had crashed down into this world, and out of which Max had emerged. I drew him walking away, off to explore the world, while the inhabitants of the world came forth to investigate the new appearance. Most of these characters come from the cover of "We All Wear Cloaks," though the flying dollar bills come from "Now That Your Dollar Bills Have Sprouted Wings," and the cricket from "Last Night You Were a Dream." I also added the cemetery from "Don't Act Like Your Heart Isn't Hard" on the left to give the hill some more depth and contribute to the overall dark theme.

					<h2>"Hey. HEY. Hey!"</h2>
					<h4>(Dry&nbsp;erase&nbsp;marker,&nbsp;March&nbsp;2011)</h4>
					<p>
					Throughout college I kept a small whiteboard on my door, and amongst the messages from friends, I would often do a quick sketch. One of these sketches, a wrinkly and delirious-looking old man's head, particularly appealed to me, and after a few days, I cleared the rest of the board and began to expand the drawing. There wasn't enough space to give the man a full body, so I I gave him a caterpillar body, which could wrap around the bottom of the whiteboard. What if this caterpillar man was wearing an ill-fitting sweater? Performing terrible stand-up comedy? These are the kinds of questions I would ask myself each time I came to a new section of the drawing, and they helped me achieve the exact look of fantastical grotesque caricature I was aiming for.

					<h2>Abstract Matrix</h2>
					<h4>(Pencil,&nbsp;December&nbsp;2007)</h4>
					<p>
						I was in a drawing class in high school, and had been asked to draw a still-life of a potted plant as an exercise in depth and shading. I didn't find this to be a particularly inspiring prompt, so I instead started doodling in my sketchbook. My very supportive teacher came around to see my progress, and upon spotting one of my sketches, some black and white ovular forms scattered over a grid, he suggested I fill that sketch out, on a full 18"x24" sheet of paper, giving the forms texture and depth. I was much happier with this idea. Since the original prompt was about developing depth, I focused especially on how light would play across these forms, making sure each element was casting shadows on its surroundings. I chose the materials of the grid to further explore lighting and texture. The horizontal icicles challenged me with reflection and refraction, while the vertical sponge columns were a challenge in creating a uniform yet random pattern.

				My relationship with video began around the age of 10, when my parents first allowed me to play with their camcorder. Without editing software or tape decks, I edited my short movies in-camera, rewinding to the right spot for each cut and re-recording, usually multiple times, until the timing was right and the take was good. Needless to say, when I first experienced Final Cut Pro as a freshman in high school, I was ecstatic, and quickly fell in love with the digital editing process. I started doing videography for plays and events, but was dissatisfied with the lack of creativity these jobs required. To make the work more interesting, I taught myself how to build intricate DVD menus, for which I would create simple 2D and 3D animations. However, I didn't really scratch the surface of animation until I was able to take a few computer animation classes in college.

					<h2>Lethal Bark Visual</h2>
					<h4>(AfterEffects,&nbsp;June&nbsp;2011)</h4>
					<p>
						This video is one of a set, which I produced for the songs of band <a href="http://lethalbark.com/" target="_blank">Lethal Bark's</a> first demo album. The band was looking for something simple, with the only real requirement being that the lyrics were somehow showcased. Being that their logo was circular, using it to simulate a turning vinyl was an easy parallel to make. The addition of a pumping speaker made things more visually interesting, and provided a source for the lyrics. Since the layout was so minimal, other than manually adding the lyrics to each video, the real challenge of the project became attention to detail in each element. Things like matching the speaker's oscillation to the average BPM of each song, adding a faint crackle as the needle touches down, or changing the offset between the player's arm and its shadow were what made this project really fun.

					<h2>Infinite Chips</h2>
					<h4>(Shake,&nbsp;April&nbsp;2011)</h4>
					<p>
						This project was an assignment for a digital media class, intended to demonstrate chroma keying and motion tracking using the compositing program Shake. I have always found recursion fascinating, and on the date I had access to the green screen room, I happened to have an empty chip bag with me, which inspired this video's concept. Unfortunately, all of the school's cameras had been checked out, so I had to resort to an iPhone, which a classmate operated for the shot. This presented numerous challenges, starting with the fact that the handheld footage was shaky, and including the iPhone's automatic color correction, which shifted multiple times during the shot. The shaking wasn't a huge issue once tracking began, as I was already moving elements around the screen, it just became one more factor to deal with. To deal with the initial motion, I set myself on a cloud floating in the sky. The ridiculous nature of this setup makes the fact that the cloud is shaking all over the place less problematic. Ultimately, both the shaking and color issues meant that I simply had to do a lot of manual editing of mattes and motion keyframes, a tedious but satisfying process, and one which taught me a lot more than I would have gotten from perfectly still, clear footage.

					<p>
						This project for my second computer animation class took up most of the semester, as it started only with a sketch of the character, "Dippy," and required I model, rig, shade, light, and animate the rest. I came up with the concept during the modeling phase, when I couldn't stop seeing Dippy as looking like a lamp. When it came to shading, I used the same photo texture on Dippy's "head" as on the lamp shade, and the lamp's brass on Dippy's leg, changing material setting to give them the right look, including bump mapping on Dippy for a skin look. Unique to the Dippy model is the volumetric shader on his toenails, which was required by the assignment.

				When I first started editing digital graphics, I was using the lasso and pencil tools in AppleWorks, changing recognizable logos to be somewhat humorous and often crude. Exactly how I progressed from those beginnings to paying work is a bit hazy, but it certainly involved teaching myself Photoshop and demonstrating an ability to produce original designs. My early work was mostly on posters, and occasionally icon design, both of which posed fun challenges, but my interest was really piqued when I started doing web design. In designing websites, I was practicing layout and iconography together, and had to add in the element of user experience. It is this kind of multi-faceted challenge that I find most fulfilling.
				<br><br>As a large part of building a website is writing the code, I will include a note on projects which are also listed in the Code section. Entries here will focus exclusively on the design process.

				Much to my disappointment, my high school didn't provide any programming classes, so when I started building websites, I had to figure things out for myself. My first steps were in Dreamweaver, which allowed me to lay out my site visually. I could then open up the source code and play with attributes to figure out what they did. Using this method, I got pretty comfortable with HTML and CSS, but when I got to Javascript, I had to turn to online resources. By the end of high school I could do basic DOM manipulation, and was just starting to look into PHP. My first year at college, I finally took two introductory programming courses, which filled me in on some core concepts, and one advanced course, building a ray-tracer in C++, which at the time, was one of the most challenging projects I had ever taken on. With this foundation, my interest and skills have only continued to grow.

				If I had gone to any other college, I would probably have majored in either computer science, electrical engineering, or mechanical engineering. Instead I went to Hampshire College, which doesn't have majors at all, so I split my time between aspects of all three, ending my time there concentrating on Robotics. This had its difficulties, as there was no robotics program at Hampshire, but ultimately the resources were available, and the atmosphere was incredibly supportive of self-driven learning. Robotics is still relatively new to me, but it provides exactly the kind of complex problem solving I'm always looking for, and I can't imagine a better application of my skills, than to a field which is I see as poised to massively improve quality of life for countless people.

				From the moment my father taught me to swing a hammer, learning new tools has come naturally to me, and I have rarely been at a loss in figuring out how to put something together. This comfort with craft has given me the opportunity to ask more important questions: instead of "How can this come together?" I ask, "How <i>should</i> this come together? What approach will be strongest, look the best, and most positively affect the end-product's usability?" As I gain skills and experience, these questions only become more apparent and important, but they have always been there, driving the process of everything I make.

				While most of the things I make these days are designed to serve a function, I still feel inclined to make the occasional piece that exists only for its own sake. I would not say I've made anything that has an intended "meaning," but instead I find an undeniable satisfaction in creating something that's simply nice to look at and have around. It's not a particularly noble goal, but this is what drives my sculpture. Despite the very spacial and visual way I have of experiencing the world, I have never found sculpture an effective outlet for emotion, or conveying a message. Instead, it is a sort of meditation, or in some cases, a puzzle, but one whose solution can only be reached by organic evolution.

				Although I only started cooking for myself about two years ago, in that short time it has become hugely important to me. Other than simple standbys, I try to avoid making the same dish often, I cook across multiple cuisines, and go out of my way to make as much of the meal from scratch as I can, just to get a better sense of all the ingredients. When I found myself spending more time on every meal, I started taking pictures to track my progression, and in building this site, I wanted to present cooking as a significant part of my life.
